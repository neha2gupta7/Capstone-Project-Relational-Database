# Advanced Hospital Management System (HMS) Database

The Advanced Hospital Management System (HMS) Database provides a comprehensive and flexible framework to manage patient care, billing, appointments, inventory, and more. By integrating real-time data access, role-based access control, audit logs, and analytics, this database supports efficient hospital operations while improving patient outcomes and enhancing the overall hospital experience.


**Database Management and Security Considerations:**

**Data Encryption**: Sensitive data (e.g., patient records, billing details) should be encrypted at rest and in transit (SSL/TLS).

**Backup and Recovery**: The database should be set up with automated backup and recovery solutions to prevent data loss.

**Scalability**: The database should support partitioning for large datasets (e.g., patient records) to improve performance as the hospital grows.

**Compliance with Regulations**: The database schema should be compliant with regulations like HIPAA (for the U.S.) or GDPR (for Europe), ensuring that patient data is handled securely and responsibly.
